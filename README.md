# React Native Uninitialized State Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable before it has been initialized. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

The `bug.js` component fetches data from an API.  It attempts to render the data before it has finished fetching, leading to an error or undefined behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file addresses the issue using conditional rendering.  It only attempts to render the data if it exists, preventing errors caused by accessing an uninitialized variable. This is a best practice to avoid unexpected behavior or app crashes in React Native apps.
